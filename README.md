Metis Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on MTA Turnstile Data

Project Proposal Template
Before you start project work for a course, you should be able to complete the following proposal template, addressing the questions listed as completely as possible. However, keep in mind that throughout the design iterations of your project, many parts of it will likely change (i.e., increase/decrease in the number of samples, types of features or algorithm used, etc.), so this is just a starting point. Also, if you are unsure in some areas, you should still submit a partial proposal to receive feedback from instructors.

In addition to submitting this plan, students are encouraged to schedule a one-on-one "scoping" meeting with an instructor to discuss the areas below.

Question/Need:

What is the question behind your analysis or model and what practical impact will your work have?
Who is your client and how will that client benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
Note: What we’re looking for here is more about who would be interested in the practical application of your work rather than details of a specific organization.
Data Description:

What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data? Please include a link! (The link can be to the dataset you’re downloading, the site you’re scraping, etc.)
What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? In other words, what does one row or observation of the data represent?
What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? In other words, what are your columns of interest?
Tools:

How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Template
MVPs are a core step in effective project development and can be thought of as the smallest amount of work needed to meaningfully address your project's key question/purpose. That doesn't mean they necessarily answer the question, but instead that they provide something immediately functional and useful that can receive feedback and be built upon.

A helpful analogy: if you're designing a transportation vehicle, your final product might be a car, but your MVP on the way there is a skateboard. It's a useful tool that provides transport and is significantly easier to build, and your client can more quickly confirm that this is the type of product that they're looking for before you invest more time and effort into enhancing it.

In the context of Metis projects, MVPs will typically be simple results (relevant to your question) from a preliminary analysis or a functional baseline model/system. Their key prerequisite is access to data amenable to analysis/modeling, so they also serve as a check on your project progress. In its simplest terms, you can think of an MVP submission as the answer to "show us what you have so far".
MVP Goal:

What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
